Monsoons bring torrential downpour which makes it an inappropriate time to travel through Tamil Nadu, Summer, however, is perfect for exploring the hills stations. Tourists can pick the region they wish to see according to the season because offseason visits could be extremely inconvenient for some."

Sightseeing during this time is not very convenient because of the improper temperature. The season, however, is visited to witness the festival of Chithirai held in the Madurai temple in the month of March-April. Puthandu, another important festival that marks the Tamil New year falls in mid-April and Mahamahan Festival is celebrated in March (celebrated once in 12 years). If visiting during summer, it is a good idea to visit the attractions on higher attitudes. Hill stations like Ooty, Kodaikanal and Yelagiri hills are the best where the temperature is pleasant and has scenic views that tourists can witness."

        content : "This southern state sees monsoon two times a year - once between June to September and the retreating monsoon in November and December. The temperature is slightly less than what it is in the summer season. It ranges between 25°C and 30°C. The rains often occur in long spells and the humidity during this time is high especially in coastal regions. Some of the hilly areas see massive rainfall and venturing out during this time around is not a great idea. The Eastern seaboard of Tamil Nadu sometimes experiences cyclones during the late monsoon, making it an unsafe place to visit."
